# Sudoswap x Abacus Integration :)

TLDR: This integration allows for anyone who decides to deposit an NFT in Sudo or borrow against one on Abacus to do both! Users will be able to splice their NFT so that the actual NFT LPs in Sudoswap, while ownership of the LP position is still held by the contract and can be borrowed against on Abacus as if it was the real NFT itself.
